154,,,,,,,Marshall; I'm wondering if the bug has something to do with the following: when you create a client; the second parameter to the constructor determines the random seed used by the client. That second parameter I think is supposed to be the client's id; but what is passed is clients.size(). I might be wrong here but I don't see where this vector of clients is cleared in between tests; so is it true that at some point the set size is fixed and all the seeds are the same ?

722,,,,x,,x,Out of curiosity; could we save a FOLLOWING notification as our lastMessage then; even if we don't send it? That would give you the 'current' state more accurately than a stale LOOKING notification and it seems like it could solve this particular problem. We could; but that wouldn't give an accurate state as well. A peer might be in the LOOKING state (next FLE round) while the lastMessage gets sent. There will be race conditions. In my opinion; a better way of doing this is to send the current state instead of lastMessage. In which case; I agree with Flavio that sending the final notifications won't be necessary. This will also reduce the number of notifications exchanged.

7380,,,,,,,As a work around; I scan the XML document to locate the namespaces which are then compared against a look-up file to see which schemas to load in the grammar. The only reason this was done is because DOMEntityResolver did not trigger for all namespaces. I am using version 2.7 and the option to trigger on all namespaces would be useful.

10314,,,,,,,First I want to verify that Gretchen's fix >Additional Comments From Gretchen Chiaramonte 2003-09-22 20:04 ------- for this bug works for me as well using Xalan 2.6.0. Second; regarding: >Additional Comments From Igor Hersht 2003-08-12 22:59 ------- ... >If I recall correctly we had such discussion before. >We consider that as a wrong usage. >The correct method would be to create transformer and >to do multiple transformations like >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); >transformer.transform(xmlSource;outputTarget); To help clarify what Gretchen has already implied; I believe that this doesn't complete the story. Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call; the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore; until this bug is repaired; the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious; a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work; partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ;-). In addition; Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs.

Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call; the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore; until this bug is repaired; the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious; a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work; partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ;-). In addition; Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs.

If AVT's aren't used; the error should be caught statically and you should see the message: Illegal value: sideways used for ENUM attribute: order. Valid values are: ascending descending. Do we have a testcase where the invalid value is in an AVT?

11978,,,,,x,,Unfortunatly; this minimal example is not very small ... When i try to simplify it to reduce size; it stops to crash because of different memory allocations sizes it goes through the other code branches. The problem can be reproduced only by transforming two files HAC_OPER_HIER.xml and HAC_OPER_LIST_FORM.xml with one XalanTransformer without recreating it (i modified attached xalanexe.cpp to reproduce it)

15698,,,,,,,I believe this is an issue. I have an action saveAction which I want to chain to editAction whenever there is a validation error. This is often necessary because a JSP will be displayed which has dynamic content such as a selectable list of items. However; if editAction has validation support; it will never be executed (even if it would validate successfully).

On the other hand; if we want an object; we could used the value attribute. I guess what i'm trying to say is that both way of using param have their own usage. Of course this is just my 2 cents

If there is at least one callback url to a page then it is stateful. It will be tracked in a different ticket. The last patch will stay even if the new approach works because it is a good optimization.

19722,,x,,,,,Just an idea: how about treating a jar as versioned resource? For example in my case that would work beautifully: my star rating component was in its own jar file; so everything would have the same version somewhere above; and all the relative URLs would resolve just fine. Since jar is pretty much invisible at runtime maybe we can have some version marker inside package; and then version in the URL can be at the level; so all other relative URLs inside package would work fine below that level. That might make sense for other cases: for example a skin for application where bunch of images and css and scripts can be packaged.

24867,,,,,,,Updated version of the patch. Removed the setter for the log storage provider in the stanza relay; and passed it either as constructor parameter of through provider registry as with other providers. If there is a need for a more generic stanza logger; these users could use the plain interface. The adapter I made is intended for filtering; so that only textual chat messages between users are let through; which I think is the most interesting detail to be logged. I updated the source file name and the comment to better indicate this.

30436,,,,,,,This one will probably not make 2.1 release. It is some bug in the SWT impl on the Mac; but for widgets that are now 'deprecated' in Eclipse. The fix will include upgrading the widgets used (and losing Eclipse compatiblity for levels prior to 3.1 I think - which was why this upgrade wasn't done earlier).

38950,x,,x,,,,I've re-worked my code and the problem has now 'gone away'. The original code; where the problem was found; was ported from a solution that worked fine using ADF controls. The same code resulted in this problem. I moved some controls on the page around and altered some of the attributes and the tree table now collapses and expands as expected. Quite why the re-work has now eliminated the problem I do not know but as I need to progress with other things I've decided to close this issue rather than waste anymore of anybody's time. Thanks for all your help anyway.

ERROR [[RP]] Servlet.service() for servlet RP threw exception [exec] java.lang.IllegalStateException Code: @InjectObject('service:tapestry.portlet.ActionResponse') public abstract javax.portlet.ActionResponse getActionResponse(); getActionResponse().sendRedirect(Portal-Login-Url); The Exception is thrown; but the redirect still works and every action done before seems to be rolled back (redirect to Portal-Login works; but Portlet-Login not) So i modified the service method of AbstractEngine to catch IllegalStateException: public void service(WebRequest request; WebResponse response) throws IOException { ... catch (PageRedirectException ex) { ?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ähandlePageRedirectException(cycle; ex); } catch (RedirectException ex) { ?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ähandleRedirectException(cycle; ex); } catch (StaleLinkException ex) { ?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ähandleStaleLinkException(cycle; ex); } catch (StaleSessionException ex) { ?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ähandleStaleSessionException(cycle; ex); } //New catch(IllegalStateException ex) { ?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ä?•?ähandleIllegalStateException(cycle; ex); } ... I know; thats not the ideal solution; but it works with Liferay.

But the issue is that; I might be having 50 or even 500 multi select boxes in my application depending upon the records in my database. If I implement reset method; I dont want to iterate each check box and reset it to a default value. Is there any way to reset all the multi select boxes to a default value; in one shot. As per your suggestion; I need to get the request parameters and compare their values with those of the multi select box selected options and reset it accordingly? My question here is; multi-selectbox A(String[]) is having a default value null. Once data is loaded from database A's value is {x;y}. If user unselects both the x and y in browser for this multi-select box then it is still showing the {x;y} in my Action class when I pass the values back to database. what I'm expecting is a null value for A. Please let me know how to resolve this. Thanks and Regards; Sreedhar. http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927?page=comments#action_37962 ] the request only if the checkbox/select is selected. If you dont unselect it; you wont get the key=value in your request. method of the ActionForm; reset the value for the array i.e. retaining previous values if none is selected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- URL: http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927 Struts 1 Affects Versions: 1.2 Family is the HTML for my element. size='3' ><option value='1'>ABC</option> selected='selected'>DEF</option> <option value='6' selected='selected'>JKL</option> value='9'>MNO</option> selected='selected'>VWX</option> selected='selected'>YZA</option> <option value='1111'>FFFFF</option> <option value='209'>TQPN</option> </select> database. If I re-visit the application and deselect all the options selected in this box; it is not reflecting to show empty list.

But the issue is that; I might be having 50 or even 500 multi select boxes in my application depending upon the records in my database. If I implement reset method; I dont want to iterate each check box and reset it to a default value. Is there any way to reset all the multi select boxes to a default value; in one shot. As per your suggestion; I need to get the request parameters and compare their values with those of the multi select box selected options and reset it accordingly? My question here is; multi-selectbox A(String[]) is having a default value null. Once data is loaded from database A's value is {x;y}. If user unselects both the x and y in browser for this multi-select box then it is still showing the {x;y} in my Action class when I pass the values back to database. what I'm expecting is a null value for A. Please let me know how to resolve this. Thanks and Regards; Sreedhar. http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927?page=comments#action_37962 ] the request only if the checkbox/select is selected. If you dont unselect it; you wont get the key=value in your request. method of the ActionForm; reset the value for the array i.e. retaining previous values if none is selected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- URL: http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927 Struts 1 Affects Versions: 1.2 Family is the HTML for my element. size='3' ><option value='1'>ABC</option> selected='selected'>DEF</option> <option value='6' selected='selected'>JKL</option> value='9'>MNO</option> selected='selected'>VWX</option> selected='selected'>YZA</option> <option value='1111'>FFFFF</option> <option value='209'>TQPN</option> </select> database.

75762,,,x,,,x,Hi Dave; ?•?ä I am not JIRA wise; I'll see if I can change the original; if not; I'll start a new thread. ?•?ä It worries me that the last binaries are two years old. It seems to say that nobody is using WS-RM; which I can understand. ?•?ä I will check with Axis2 1.5 before I update the JIRA.

75762,,,,,,x,Hi Dave; ?•?ä I am not JIRA wise; I'll see if I can change the original; if not; I'll start a new thread. ?•?ä It worries me that the last binaries are two years old.

I am testing the samples provided. The syncpingclient works fine (after a few updates) in W-RM 1.0 but not for WS-RM 1.1. When using WS-RM 1.1;?•?ä the anonymous replyTo is not understood as such and is treated as an actual URL. When a CreateSequence message is sent; the response is of course never received; with an UnknownHostException. The debug log looks fine; in that the correct processing seems to take place. What am I missing ? Your help will be greatly appreciated.

We can add such migration steps in release also with some migration.txt or in change log file itself. Ideas?

Right or wrong; it's by all accounts the dominant convention for similar .i files from other projects; and that's good enough for me. However! It depends on QPID-4207; and that's much too big change to dist metadata for our final release candidate. This will have to wait.
